# About the project

Wavetrace is a platform that supports the fulfillment of music orders for personal use, along with the transfer of copyright. The user creates an account and fills out an order form, detailing the type of music they need or its intended use. After 24 hours, the user receives a freshly composed 1-minute version of the music with a watermark in the dashboard on their profile. If the user likes the composed music, they can proceed with the payment process. Upon payment, the track is available for download in high-quality audio without the watermark. There is also an option to edit the composed track for a smaller fee or to extend the 1-minute version to, for example, a 5-minute version for a higher fee.

## Technologies

- Authorization management, music storage, and other data handling were implemented using Firebase services, including Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Realtime Database.

- The project was created in TypeScript using the React.js library.

- <b>SASS</b> preprocessor, <b>Bootstrap</b>, and <b>Material UI</b> for some ready-made components were used for styling.

- Animations were implemented using the <b>GSAP</b> library by GreenSock.

- State management: Redux

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
