    question: "How quickly will my music be created?",
    response: `Orders are processed within 24 hours from the moment of placing the order.
    Your music may be ready in a shorter timeframe. This is entirely dependent

    You can always reach out to support to find out the status of your track.`,

    question: "My order is delayed.",
    response: `If your order is delayed, please contact support immediately. Orders that
    are fulfilled late are eligible for a discount based on the extent of the
    delay.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I disable 3 orders per day limit?",
    response: `By default, each user has a limit of 3 orders per day. In cases of high volume of unrestricted
    orders, delays may occur. All orders, which are delayed for various
    reasons, are eligible for a discount based on the extent of the delay. Currently, there is no option to disable the limit of 3 orders per day.`,
  },
  {
    question: "I would like to request a refund.",
    response: `There is no possibility of a refund. The ordered music is produced and provided with a watermark for free to be verified and accepted by the client. The client voluntarily and knowingly decides to purchase the composed track without the possibility of a refund.`,
  },
  {
    question: "I don't see my orders.",
    response: `All your orders should be visible in the dashboard or in the trash folder. If you don't see your orders, both newly placed and completed ones, please contact support immediately.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I edit my music indefinitely?",
    response: `Yes, you can modify your track as many times as you want. Each additional modification costs $5. If you make enough modifications that the price of the created track is reduced to $14, the price will not be reduced further, and each subsequent modification will still cost $5.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How to permanently delete an order?",
    response: `It is not possible to permanently delete an order. This is related to the overlapping limits of 3 orders per day. All deleted orders can be found in the trash folder and serve as a history of user actions.`,
